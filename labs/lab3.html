            For the following exercises, we will be running a web application using a REST API (Powered by <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>).</br>
            Once the application is running, Lab 3 will be located at <a href="http://localhost:3000/lab3" target="_blank">this url</a>.</br>
            Open your Notepad++ editor and open up the unzipped directory.</br>
            For this lab, you will be working with the files:</br>
            </br> 
            -views/lab3.ejs (which contains your HTML markup)</br>
            -public/javascripts/lab3/main.js (which is where you will write your JavaScript code)</br>
            </br>
            To see the output of console.log() statements in the Debugger console, right-click on your browser window, select "Inspect Element" which will open the Developer Tools window, and navigate to the "Console" tab to view the output. Feel free to use this a means of debugging. You can also go to the "Elements" tab in the Developer Tools window to examine the current layout of your DOM.</br>

            Navigate to and examine the Lab 3 workspace page in your browser. You should notice an <strong>Employees List</strong> table along with a <strong>Add New Employee</strong> form. </br>
            </br>
            Open the lab3.ejs page in your text editor and take a moment to examine the HTML markup. You will notice that the current page contents are being drawn from the <strong>employeeManagementViewTpl</strong> HTML template</br>
            </br>
            Open the /lab3/main.js in your text editor and take a moment to examine the existing JS code. You will notice there is only a single Backbone View called <strong>EmployeeManagementView</strong>. It contains a few properties.
          </p>
          <ul class='lead'>
            <li><em>template</em>: Uses JQuery to retrieve the HTML template from the DOM</li>
            <li><em>initialize</em>: The first method that is called when an instance of the view is created. Used to do any view setup/initialization.</li>
            <li><em>render</em>: This method is used to compile a template and append it to the view's container element</li>
            <li><em>events</em>: This object is where you add any event bindings on the view. For instance, we have a single event binding on the button with id#randomButton. When that button is clicked, the triggerRandomBtnAction() method is triggered.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead">
            All views in Backbone have an <strong>el</strong> property. This is essentially a reference to the DOM element it corresponds to. Even if the View has not been rendered yet, it still has an el property. All views also have an <strong>$el</strong> property, which is a JQuery-wrapped reference of its DOM. This is what is typically used to interact with the view. Read <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#View-el" target="_blank">this</a> for further clarification.
            </br>
            </br>
            In the current page setup, The JavaScript defines and creates an instance of EmployeeManagementView. This view is bound to the DOM element with id <em>employeeManagementView</em>. The DOM content for this view is rendered from the HTML template with id <em>employeeManagementViewTpl</em>. Take 2-3 minutes to familiarize yourself with this structure and understand it before proceeding with the questions.

            <li class="question">
              <p>Create a Backbone Model definiton called <strong>Employee</strong> that will be used to interface with individual employee objects we pull down from our REST API.</p>
              Hints:
              <ul>
                <li>The employee objects returned from the REST route use '_id' as the id. Backbone uses 'id' as its default id, so we need a way to tell Backbone to use '_id' as the unique id. We do this by adding a property called 'idAttribute' to the model definition and set it to be "_id"</li>
                <li>Remember to bind it to the App.Models namespace! A <strong>namespace</strong> is a way of structure and organizing code to that we can easily refer to different objects. In JavaScript, this is typically done by creating objects, and then adding properties to those objects for additional namespaces (for instance, we have a general namespace called 'App', and then we extend that namespace with additional namespaces for 'Models', 'Views')
              </ul>

              <p>Create a Backbone Collection definiton called <strong>Employees</strong> that will be used to interact with our <strong>/employees</strong> REST endpoint.</p>
              <p>Remember to bind it to the App.Collections namespace!</p>
              <p>Create an instance of this collection where indicated in the JS comments. Call the <em>.fetch()</em> method of this instance to retrieve the list of employees. This will automatically make the AJAX HTTP GET request, and when the list of employees is returned, it will create <em>Employee</em> Models for each and automatically add them to the collection.</p>

            <li class="question">
              <p>Implement the <em>Add New Employee</em> form behavior so that new employees can be added to the table.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You should create a Backbone View to represent a row view in the table.</li>
                <li>The row view should use the template <strong>employeeTableRowTpl</strong></li>
                <li>Each row view instance should have an <em>Employee</em> model associated with it</li>
                <li>The employeeManagementView instance should be passed the instance of your <em>Employee's</em> collection</li>
                <li>The employeeManagementView should use the Backbone <em>listenTo()</em> method and listen to any 'add' events on the collection it is passed (which is referred to by this.collection). When this event is triggered, your view should bind a callback function that will create an employee row view for the new employee. Your callback function should have one argument, which is the Backbone Model for the newly added employee.</li>

            <li class="question">
              <p>Once you have the above functionality working, you will notice that each row has an <em>Alert Info</em> button. Currently, this button does nothing.</p>
              <p>Implement this button's functionality so that it calls the JavaScript <em>alert()</em> method with that row's information formatted in the following way:</p>
              <p class="help-block">"Name: {name}, Email: {email}, Rank: {rank}, Title: {title}"</p>

            <li class="question">
              <p>You will also notice that each row has a <em>Delete</em> button.Currently, this button does nothing.</p>
              <p>Implement this button's functionality so that it:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Deletes the employee from the server</li>
                <li>Removes the row from the table</li>
                <li>Remove the employee from the employee's collection</li>
                <li>Hint: Use the Backbone Model <em>destroy()</em> and Backbone View <em>remove()</em> methods. See Backbone documentation page for further information.</li>
